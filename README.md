    <h1><strong>Pneumonia Detection with Transfer Learning</strong></h1>
</div>

### This repo was created for the NAAMII Research Assistant Assignment.

## üéØ Objectives

This notebook aims to develop a robust Pneumonia Detection Model using Transfer Learning. It examines both traditional CNNs and pre-trained models, including MobileNetV3,
InceptionV3, and the latest EfficientNetV2 B0. This study involves analysing the performance of
the models using selected metrics to compare their effectiveness

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used to train the model in this notebook is the [Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification (Version 2)](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2), published on 6 January 2018.

Kaggle Version: [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia?datasetId=17810&sortBy=dateRun)

## How to use the Notebook
